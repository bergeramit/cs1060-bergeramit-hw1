I worked on building a Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) using NASA's public API.
Every day you get the Nasa's APOD  along an explanation and the date.
I have a lot of issues coming from lovable to github and then Bolt, after configurations, authorization and some resets I managed to get the repo up and running on Bolt.
Another issue was a reset I got from the API endpoint for "sending too many requests at once" - which is a nice challenge. I could either wait for I don't know how long, or search for a solution.
Finnaly, I connectet to a VPN to retest the setups since all was coming from my browser's IP -> VPN will look to NASA as a new IP request - and will approve it. And it worked!!
Total time: 2.5 hour
